DockingHost
===========

The DockingHost project is a little framework for dockable forms.

The source is written as a draft, so you can integrate it into your project at once.
Only the MainForm.pas is written as an example showing how to use the framework.

HowTo
-----
The only thing you have to do is to inherit the main-form of your own project from the
DockHost.pas (have a look on the MainForm.pas, it shows how this is done).
